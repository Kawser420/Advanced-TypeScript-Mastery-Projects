## About

This repository contains a single, focused TypeScript exercise and a minimal web runner. The goal is to demonstrate advanced TypeScript patterns, correctness, and readability in a compact, production-minded example.

The project is deliberately small so reviewers can quickly inspect architecture, types, and algorithms while still seeing professional-level documentation and usage guidance.

## Highlights

- Single-file advanced TypeScript problem: `100-advanced-ts-problem.ts` — contains the primary implementation and inline examples.
- Minimal web runner: `index.html` — lets reviewers open the solution in a browser quickly.
- Clean, intention-revealing types and comments suitable for code review or client presentation.

## Repository Structure

Top-level files you will find:

- `100-advanced-ts-problem.ts` — The main TypeScript source showing the advanced problem and its solution.
- `index.html` — Simple web page that can load a compiled JS bundle or demonstrate the output for quick manual inspection.
- `README.md` — (this file) professional project overview and usage instructions.

If you expand this repository into a fuller project, recommended additions include a `package.json`, a `tsconfig.json`, unit tests under a `tests/` folder, and CI configuration (GitHub Actions).

## Prerequisites

You only need one of these to run or preview the project locally:

- Node.js (LTS) with npm (recommended for a development workflow)
- A TypeScript toolchain (tsc, ts-node, or esbuild) OR a modern browser for running built JS

Optional global utilities used in the examples below (you can also use npx):

- `http-server` (for quick local static hosting)

## Quick Start

There are two quick ways to preview the project locally: using Node/TypeScript tooling, or using a static file preview.

1. Using ts-node (one-shot execution of the TypeScript file):

```powershell
# Install ts-node once (optional) and run the example directly
npm i -g ts-node typescript  # optional; you can also use npx
npx ts-node 100-advanced-ts-problem.ts
```

2. Compile to JavaScript and open `index.html` in the browser:

```powershell
# Create a quick tsconfig and compile (example)
npx tsc --init --rootDir . --outDir dist --esModuleInterop --resolveJsonModule --lib es2020,dom --target es2020
npx tsc 100-advanced-ts-problem.ts --outDir dist
# Then open the index.html or serve the folder
# start a quick static server from the project root (optional)
npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1
# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and inspect the demo
```

3. Open `index.html` directly in the browser (works if the page only relies on included JS/CSS and not on server-only APIs).

## Running the Example

The repository is intentionally minimal. The file `100-advanced-ts-problem.ts` contains both the implementation and a small example harness. Running it with `ts-node` prints sample output to the console. Compiling with `tsc` and opening `index.html` shows the result in a browser context.

Example expected behavior (summary):

- The TypeScript file demonstrates advanced typing patterns and a complete solution for the included problem.
- Example input and expected output are included in comments and in the file's sample runner function.

Note: Because this repository doesn't include a `package.json` by default, the Quick Start uses `npx` so reviewers can run things without modifying the repo.

## How to Read the Code

When reviewing `100-advanced-ts-problem.ts`, look for the following:

- Top-level type contracts describing function inputs and outputs.
- Small, well-named helper functions with single responsibilities.
- Inline comments that explain non-obvious algorithmic choices.
- A testable, decoupled `solve` (or equivalent) function that can be imported by a test harness.

If you would like, I can split the file into modules (e.g., `src/` + `lib/`) and add a `package.json` with scripts for build/test in a follow-up.

## Recommended Development Workflow

- Add a `package.json` and dependencies:

```powershell
npm init -y
npm i -D typescript ts-node @types/node
```

- Add a `tsconfig.json` (basic one can be created with `npx tsc --init`).
- Add npm scripts to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "ts-node 100-advanced-ts-problem.ts",
    "serve": "http-server -p 8080"
  }
}
```

These scripts standardize common tasks and make the repo friendlier to evaluators.

## Testing & Validation

This repository is small and doesn't include a test runner by default. To add tests quickly, use Jest or Vitest.

Example installation (Vitest):

```powershell
npm i -D vitest @types/jest
npx vitest init
```

Write a few unit tests that import the primary exported `solve` function from `100-advanced-ts-problem.ts` and validate the example cases.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested steps for a clean contribution:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch for your change.
3. Add tests for any new behavior.
4. Ensure linting and typechecks pass.
5. Open a pull request describing your change.

For small portfolio edits (formatting, README improvements), a direct PR is fine.

## Suggested Follow-ups (for an even stronger presentation)

- Add `package.json` with `build`, `start`, and `test` scripts.
- Add `tsconfig.json` and a basic ESLint/Prettier setup.
- Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm ci && npm test` on push.
- Add a small demo GIF or screenshot showing expected output.

I can implement any of these follow-ups on request.
