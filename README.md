## Usage Examples

#### Interactive Playground

// Try TypeScript code directly in the browser
function greet(name: string): string {
return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Example of generics
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
return arg;
}

console.log(greet("TypeScript"));
console.log(identity<number>(42));

## AI Assistant

- The built-in AI assistant can help you understand TypeScript concepts:
- Ask "What are union types?"
- Request "Show me an example of generics"
- Inquire "How do type guards work?"

## Problem Solutions

#### Browse through 100+ implemented solutions:

// Example: QuickSort implementation
function quickSort<T>(arr: T[], left = 0, right = arr.length - 1): T[] {
if (left >= right) return arr;
const pivot = arr[Math.floor((left + right) / 2)];
let i = left, j = right;

while (i <= j) {
while (arr[i] < pivot) i++;
while (arr[j] > pivot) j--;
if (i <= j) [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
}

quickSort(arr, left, j);
quickSort(arr, i, right);
return arr;
}
